## Synopsis

This is a research project to find an efficient 
cache algorithm for OpenFlow Switches in Software Defined Networking.

## Motivation
The idea is taken from two different research papers which are as follows:
- [ Infinite Cacheflow]
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~nkatta/papers/cacheflow14.pdf
- [CAB: A Reactive Wildcard Rule Caching System for Software-Defined Networks]
https://engineering.nyu.edu/highspeed/sites/engineering.nyu.edu.highspeed/files/uploads/papers/hotsdn15-cab.pdf

## Installation/Compilation
-[It uses c++ boost library]
-[Install BOOST of version >= 1_55]http://www.boost.org/
