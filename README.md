# Infinite-CacheFlow-plus-CAB
This is a research project to find an efficient 
cache algorithm for OpenFlow Switches in Software Defined Networking.
>The idea is taken from two different research papers which are as follows:
>1) Infinite Cacheflow
>http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~nkatta/papers/cacheflow14.pdf
>2) CAB: A Reactive Wildcard Rule Caching System for Software-Defined Networks
